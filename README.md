# Ensemble-Techniques

1	Data privacy is always an important factor to safeguard their customers' details. For this, password strength is an important metric to track. Build an ensemble model to classify the user’s password strength.

2. A sample of global companies and their ratings are given for the cocoa bean production along with the location of the beans being used. Identify the important features in the analysis and accurately classify the companies based on their ratings and draw insights from the data. Build ensemble models such as Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting on the dataset given.

3.	Most cancers form a lump called a tumour. But not all lumps are cancerous. Doctors extract a sample from the lump and examine it to find out if it’s cancer or not. Lumps that are not cancerous are called benign (be-NINE). Lumps that are cancerous are called malignant (muh-LIG-nunt). Obtaining incorrect results (false positives and false negatives) especially in a medical condition such as cancer is dangerous. So, perform Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting algorithms to increase model performance and provide your insights in the documentation

4.	Given is the diabetes dataset. Build an ensemble model to correctly classify the outcome variable and improve your model prediction by using GridSearchCV. You must apply Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting on the dataset.
